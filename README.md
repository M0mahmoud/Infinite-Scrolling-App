The App component is the main component in this code. It serves as the interface for the user to search for books and display the results.

It has the following features:
- Input field for entering the search query
- Display of the books data as a list
- Infinite scrolling feature using the `IntersectionObserver` API and the useRef hook.

The useBookSearch hook is a custom hook that returns the necessary data for the App component to display the books data and the status of the API request.

It has the following features:
- Fetching of books data from the OpenLibrary API using Axios
- Handling of the cancel token pattern to cancel the previous API request when a new request is triggered
- Updating of the books data and the status of the API request (loading, error, and hasMore) based on the query and pageNumber arguments
